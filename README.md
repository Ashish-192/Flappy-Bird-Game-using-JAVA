1.	Imports: The necessary classes from the javax.swing and java.awt packages are imported. These classes provide the graphical user interface components and graphics capabilities needed for the game.
2.	Class Declaration: The FlappyBirdGame class is declared, which extends JPanel and implements the ActionListener interface. This allows the class to handle GUI rendering and respond to timer events.
3.	Constants and Variables:
o	Constants like BIRD_WIDTH, BIRD_HEIGHT, PIPE_WIDTH, and PIPE_GAP are defined to set the dimensions of the bird and pipes.
o	Variables for the game logic, such as birdY, birdVelocity, pipeX, upperPipeY, gameStarted, gameOver, and score, are declared to track the bird’s position, velocity, the pipe’s position, and the game state.
4.	Constructor: The FlappyBirdGame constructor sets up the game environment. It initializes the timer, sets the panel to be focusable (to receive key events), and adds a key listener to respond to key presses.
5.	Key Listener: Inside the constructor, a key listener is added to detect when the space bar is pressed (to make the bird jump) and when the “R” key is pressed (to restart the game).
6.	Restart Method: The restartGame method resets the game variables to their initial states and starts the timer again.
7.	Paint Component: The paintComponent method is overridden to draw the game’s graphics. It sets the background color and draws the bird and pipes using the Graphics object. If the game is over, it displays the score and restart prompt.
8.	Action Performed: The actionPerformed method is overridden to implement the game’s physics and logic. It updates the bird’s velocity and position, moves the pipes, checks for collisions, and updates the score.
9.	Main Method: The main method sets up the main game window (JFrame) and adds an instance of FlappyBirdGame to it. It also sets the window size, default close operation, and visibility.
10.	Running the Game: When the program is run, it creates the game window where the player can press the space bar to control the bird and try to navigate through the pipes without touching them.
11.	JPanel:
•	JPanel is a container that can hold other GUI components.
•	In this code, FlappyBirdGame extends JPanel, meaning it is a type of panel that can be added to a frame.
12.	ActionListener:
•	ActionListener is an interface used to receive action events.
•	The FlappyBirdGame class implements ActionListener to respond to events from the timer.
13.	Timer:
•	Timer is used to generate an action event at regular intervals.
•	In the game, the timer updates the game state every 20 milliseconds, moving the bird and pipes and redrawing the screen.
14.	setFocusable(true):
•	This method makes the JPanel focusable, meaning it can receive keyboard input.
•	It’s necessary for the game to receive key presses from the player.
15.	KeyAdapter and addKeyListener:
•	KeyAdapter is a class that receives keyboard events.
•	addKeyListener adds a listener to the panel to handle key events.
•	When the space bar is pressed, the bird jumps, and when “R” is pressed, the game restarts.
16.	Graphics g:
•	Graphics is a class that provides methods to draw on components.
•	In the paintComponent method, g is used to draw the game’s visuals.
17.	g.fillRect:
•	This method fills a rectangle with a specified color.
•	It’s used to draw the bird and pipes on the screen.
18.	Random:
•	Random is a class that generates random numbers.
•	It’s used to set the height of the pipes randomly.
19.	JFrame:
•	JFrame is a top-level window with a title and a border.
•	It’s the main window of the game where the JPanel is added.
20.	setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE):
•	This method sets the default operation when the user closes the frame.
•	EXIT_ON_CLOSE means the application will exit when the frame is closed.
21.	repaint():
•	This method is called to repaint the panel.
•	It’s used after updating the game state to redraw the bird and pipes in their new positions.
22.	main method:
•	The main method is the entry point of the program.
•	It creates the game window and sets it up.
23.	Background:
•	To add a background, you can create an image (e.g., a sky or landscape) and load it into the game.
•	Uncomment the line where it says // Draw background image (replace with actual background image) and replace it with the actual background image path.
24.	Bird Image:
•	Find or create an image of a bird (preferably with a transparent background).
•	Replace the red rectangle representing the bird with the actual bird image.
•	Load the bird image using birdImage = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage("bird.png"); (replace "bird.png" with the actual image path).
25.	Pipe Images:
•	Similarly, find or create images for the pipes (one for the upper pipe and one for the lower pipe).
•	Replace the blue rectangles representing the pipes with the actual pipe images.
•	Load the pipe images using pipeImage = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage("pipe.png"); (replace "pipe.png" with the actual image path).
